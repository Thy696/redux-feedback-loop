## Description

  Create an app allow the user send the feedback to database. And as the admin I can see what the user input from a link address named Admin. 

  To moving between components, I use HashRouter and assignt links to NEXT buttons.

  To connect the client-side with server-side. Via axios, I make the GET repost and POST to get the data as well as send the data. And also through axios, I create an DELETE request to delete the specific feedback by it's id.
